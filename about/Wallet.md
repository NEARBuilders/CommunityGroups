A community of NEAR wallet founders, builders and core-contributors that are dedicated to ensuring security and innovation of the NEAR wallet ecosystem.

## **Our Groups**

The NEAR Wallet Community consist of a ‚öíÔ∏è¬†public builder group and a selected working group of üß†¬†SMEs (Subject Matter Experts)

### **Working Group**

This formal group is a selected committee of subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions related to standards that affect NEAR Wallet builders. They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO or grant programs, and hold grant takers accountable. They engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation.

### Builder Group

This informal self-organized group provides a space for anyone interested in the NEAR Wallets. Members of this group include most all the leading wallet teams on NEAR, SDKs, onramps/offramps, and relevant stakeholders at Pagoda, NEAR Foundation, and Banyan.
