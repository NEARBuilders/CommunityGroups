A community of NEAR wallet founders, builders and core-contributors that are dedicated to ensuring security and innovation of the NEAR wallet ecosystem.

## **Our Groups**

The NEAR Wallet Community consist of a ‚öíÔ∏è¬†public builder group and a selected working group of üß†¬†SMEs (Subject Matter Experts)

### **Working Group**

This formal group is a selected committee of subject matter experts who make official decisions on proposals and questions related to standards that affect NEAR Wallet builders. They follow a strict process to review proposals, recommend funding to DAO or grant programs, and hold grant takers accountable. They engage with the broader community to understand their needs and encourage ideation.

This informal self-organized group provides a space for anyone interested in the NEAR Wallets. Members of this group include most all the leading wallet teams on NEAR, SDKs, onramps/offramps, and relevant stakeholders at Pagoda, NEAR Foundation, and Banyan.
